I spend my days writing application and library code, fixing bugs in things I shipped, and obsessing over bundle sizes nobody asked me to optimize.

Outside of work, I have a passion for cooking, street-style dancing (hip-hop, locking, popping, house), resistance training, running, books, and live concerts.

## Background

I was born and raised in Ukraine (🇺🇦), and at the age of 17, I moved to Canada (🇨🇦) to pursue my post-secondary education. In 2022, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ryerson University, AKA [TMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Metropolitan_University).

After graduation, I landed a full-time position at a fintech startup [Power Finance](https://usepower.com/), which was later acquired by [Marqeta](https://marqeta.com).
