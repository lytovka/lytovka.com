## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan, a software engineer at [Marqeta](https://marqeta.com) and a lifelong [Oasis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)>) fan. I spend my days writing code, fixing bugs, and entertaining my coworkers with memes.

Outside of work, I have a passion for cooking, playing the guitar (albeit amateurishly), hitting the gym, diving into books, and attending live concerts.

If you ever find yourself in Toronto, let's go for a walk sometime!

In 2022, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ryerson University, AKA [TMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Metropolitan_University).

After graduation, I landed a full-time position at the fintech startup [Power Finance](https://usepower.com/), and the rest is history...
