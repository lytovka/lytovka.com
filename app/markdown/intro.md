## Hello world!

I'm Ivan, a software engineer at [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/) and a lifelong [Oasis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)>) fan.

Most of the time these days I spend shipping product features to org repos, fixing bugs, improving performance metrics, and attending insightful meetings.

Outside of my day job duties I enjoy cooking, playing the guitar (though amateurishly), hitting the gym, reading books, and attending live concerts.
