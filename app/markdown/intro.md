## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan, a software engineer at [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/) and a lifelong [Oasis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)>) fan. I write code, fix bugs, and amuse coworkers with memes for a living.

Outside of my day job duties, I enjoy cooking, playing the guitar (though amateurishly), hitting the gym, reading books, and attending live concerts.

If you happen to be in Toronto, let's go out for a walk sometime!

Upon graduation, I accepted full-time position at fintech startup [Power Finance](https://usepower.com/). And the rest is history...
