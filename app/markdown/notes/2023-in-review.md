As I await my flight to Halifax to reconnect with my cousin, I find myself reflecting on the past year. 2022 was, by far, the worst, making even minor wins seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things. However, this year, I've been deeply introspective, which has inspired me to write a few words about how 2023 has unfolded.

## "She's Beautiful... She's From Texas"

In early January, I traveled to the US for work, landing in Austin, Texas. Initially, I had a grim view of the city, imagining it as somewhat brutal and moderately violent place where guns are common and easily used. Fortunately, my time in Austin was free of such local amusements.

Working at a remote-first startup, I had naively expected our in-person time to be work-focused. However, it turned out to be mostly a mix of teambuilding and leisure activities. My ill-fated attempt at golf, where I struggled with its difficulty, was memorable. Among other things, I also enjoyed the food at the iconic BBQ spots like [Terry Black's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6pL48fC4ToZtRsDNA) and [Franklin's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3dF8T8C2kPXGxNss9). The cuisine alone makes Texas worth visiting.

Looking back, I realize that the lack of work-centric activities in January was a prelude to significant forthcoming events of February. This trip was a valuable opportunity for team bonding before unexpected plot twist arose.

## An Overnight Buyout

The buyout didn't literally happen overnight, but that's what it seemed from my perspective when I learned that the small startup I was working for [got acquired by Marqeta](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/30/marqeta-to-acquire-fintech-infrastructure-startup-power-finance-in-200m-all-cash-deal), my current employer. This was a substantial milestone, especially in the context of particularly turbulent economic climate in the US. While I wasn’t directly involved in the deal, my work to some degree contributed to making our product line more acquisitionworthy.

Now, I'm part of a much larger company, navigating a more bureaucratic and rigid environment. But, it's safe to say that we're on a steady and promising path forward.

## A Trip That Didn’t Happen

I had big plans for a summer trip to the UK and, on a whim, decided to squeeze in a South Korean adventure beforehand.

There's a valid reason why many people delegate travel planning hassles to agencies, especially when it comes to handling visa applications. For countries like the UK or Canada, using an agency might seem like an unnecessary expense, as their instructions are typically clear and straightforward. However, for countries where English is not the primary language, such as South Korea, the investment does pay off. I thought I was smart enough to figure it all out by myself, but as it turned out I slightly overestimated my abilities.

At the South Korean consulate where I went to handle a physical visa application, it was denied because I lacked a detailed travel plan – something I hadn't adequately formulated at the time. It was a minor setback, but a lesson was learned about the intricacies of traveling to new countries.

## An Extended Sabbatical From Alcohol

In April, I wondered how a zero-alcohol lifestyle would impact my work and personal life. Since then, my intake has dramatically reduced. Previously, I would socially drink 1-3 times a week, so this was a significant change for me.

When someone abandons a habit that is deeply embedded in adult social life, it's often followed by a tendency to broadcast their more enlightened and mindful lifestyle on the Internet. However, I do recognize that the impact of changes like this aren't universally positive for everyone.

For instance, choosing not to drink alcohol in social settings can be a slight disadvantage. This is especially true if you're not naturally outgoing. A modest amount of alcohol can indeed boost confidence and make interactions smoother. Personally, though, the noticeable improvement in sleep quality after giving up alcohol was hard to ignore. So I've decided to continue this experiment into the new year.

## The Long-Awaited Trip That Did Happen

Late last year, I secured a ticket for [Blur's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MhMgCo0Bl0Kukl93PZbYS) reunion concert at the legendary Wembley Stadium, a full eight months ahead of time. My first true solo international journey was more than just a vacation. I singlehandedly managed every aspect, from visa applications to itinerary planning. After traversing 5 cities across the island, it evolved into an inward journey that was spiritually fulfilling.

I enjoyed Scotland very much.

This adventure probably deserves an essay of its own (TBD).

## Abandoning And Picking Up Hobbies

In the first half of this year, I was enthusiastic about learning to play the acoustic guitar. My goal was to comfortably play songs with basic strumming patterns, with [Oasis](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2DaxqgrOhkeH0fpeiQq2f4) as my primary inspiration and benchmark.

However, this hobby turned out to be neither as productive nor as enjoyable as I had hoped. After months of consistent practice, I barely played even notoriously simple songs like Wonderwall, and my fingers didn't quite get used to the discomfort of strumming. You can say it’s a skill issue, and I’ll reluctantly agree to that.

My remote job means I spend a significant portion of my day indoors. This was another reason I found it challenging to remain seated in the same spot after work to practice guitar; the setting simply felt too monotonous.

Lack of physical interaction was also taking its toll. This led me to seek a hobby that could fulfill my need for more dynamic, bodily expression.

This is how I found myself attending my first hip-hop class at [Studio North Toronto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k58T4N6p1VvtJqc38) in June. Since then, I've been regularly taking classes in various styles, learning from different, talented instructors. Engaging with the studio community has given me a profound sense of involvement.

I am very excited to continue mastering my dance skills and exploring body's capabilities in the coming year.

## 2023 Wrapped

As I look ahead to 2024, there are several areas I want to focus on. Firstly, I aim to drive more regularly to overcome my fear of accidents. Broadening my social circle beyond my current inner group is another goal, as it would greatly help me overcome social awkwardness. Additionally, I plan to increase my volunteering efforts to contribute more to the community and assist those in need. Revisiting the idea of traveling to South Korea in 2024 is also on the table.

One thing I've learned is that the more specific my plans are, the more likely it is for life and fate to suprise me. So I'll let this year unfold as it may and hope for the best.

I am deeply grateful for the people who have been a part of my journey throughout 2023, joining me in a path of growth and evolution. Above all, I am profoundly thankful that my parents, relatives, and close friends who remain in Ukraine are alive, managing immense challenges as best they can. I've never experienced what it's like to live in an atmosphere of war, death, and constant disruption. I pray for the day when the conflict in my country comes to a decisive end.

Cheers and Happy New Year.
