> I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. - Andy Bernard (The Office)

This month marks 10 years since my family and I moved from our hometown, Donetsk. What seemed as a temporary relocation in hopes for dust to settle turned into permanent change as the anti-government demonstrations escalated into full-scale [military conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas) in the region. Many people, including my close friends, were forced to leave their homes. And many those who stayed faced the harsh reality of war, economic stagnation, and isolation.

I find myself reminiscing about the city I once knew so well. The city where I spent my childhood, made life-long friends, and built memories I cherish and the skills I carry with me to this day.

In early childhood, I learned to ride rollerblades in [the nearby park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FonQ9QotWuAKKSyu5) and remember falling down and scrapping my knees and elbows as I accelerated down the track. I spent countless times in [the greatest amusement center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sNzL3TmunKJPkn588) with my friends, playing arcade games and going to the movies. In my teenage years, I picked up tennis racket and spent hours playing with other kids on courts or simply bouncing the ball against the wall in a [tennis club](https://www.google.com/maps/@48.0195357,37.8156032,3a,75y,114.73h,83.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSGHDYsmcRhMjf_523j4cmw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu). And later, upon my Mom's advice, I got my first exposure to dancing, where I learned basics of hip-hop, locking, and even vogue (ðŸ˜…). Our dance group would often perform at local theater, and I remember the thrill of us traveling to a dance ccompetition in Odessa back in 2012. What a time it was!

I will never forget the brainstorming sessions with my classmates in [this cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/@48.0023247,37.8019305,3a,21.8y,37.06h,90.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sX9BgVpH6DngyLzoMdZAb4g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu), where we would crack jokes for the comedy show we were preparing for the school talent show.

Many places I frequented in Donetsk look brutal, daunting, and uninviting through my adult eyes, but as a child I was not bothered by its lack of aesthetics â€“ I was too busy having fun and making memories. Unfortunately, most of the places that left look exactly the same as they did 10 years ago, as if time has stopped there. In fact, all Google Maps street views are from 2011, so I am not actually sure if things have changed at all.

The spiral of nostalgia and romanticization the careless days is a common theme now that I am older and live life so different from what it was back then. I sometimes wonder how my life would have turned out if none of this crap happened and my family had stayed in Donetsk.
